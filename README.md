## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript
- React.js

### What I learned

- Very proud of myself for this one. It's my current high, though I should eclipse it in the coming hours anyways with an even more skilled project. "Smiles"  
- Vanilla JavaScript has hundreds of very basic beginner exercises online. So was tres happy to finally discover similar for React: "9 Simple (But Important) React JS Coding Exercises You Need To Do As A Beginner". Worked through all the exercises starting a little under 24 hours ago, and this was the 9th one that encapsulated all learnings.
- A couple of tough bugs popped up here but came up victorious after much googling, looking through my past notes, and running some programming logic hack through my mind.   

### Continued development

- More React apps! 

### Useful resources

MDN Web Docs  
W3schools
